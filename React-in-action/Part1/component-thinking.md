## TASK

Visit a popular site that you enjoy and use often (like GitHub, for example) and break down the interface into components. As you go, youâ€™ll probably find yourself dividing things into separate parts.

// questions to consider

A]] When does it make sense to stop breaking things down?

> . Reusability - if a resulting element won;t be re-used across the interface then creating a separate component might be an overkill.
> . complexity- Over-componentization can make the code harder to understand and maintain. If breaking down further makes things more complex then its better to leave it as so.

B]] Should an individual letter be a component?

> .Typically individual letter are usually styled with css as part of a larger component such as a heading or paragraph hence not advisable.

C]] When might it make sense for a component to be something small?

> . Reusability - Smaller components are generally more reusable across different parts of the interface. For instance, a well-designed button component can be used for various actions throughout the website, promoting consistency and reducing development time.

> . Isolation - Keeping logic isolated within a small component makes the code easier to understand, test, and maintain.

> . Readability - Smaller components often improve code readability. By breaking it down, it makes the code easier to scan and understand, especially when working on specific functionalities.

> . Maintainability - Small components are easier to maintain and update. If a design change is needed for a button, you only have to modify the button component and not every instance of the button across the entire website.

> . Composability: Small components act like building blocks. They can be combined in various ways to create more complex UIs (user interfaces).

// Note: Over-componentization, where everything is broken down into tiny pieces, can also lead to complexity in managing the relationships between components. Consider the trade-off between reusability and maintainability when deciding how small to make a component.

D]] When would it make sense to consider a grouping of
things as one component?

> . Shared functionality:
> . They appear together frequently:
> . State Management
